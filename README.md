## 🔮 Forecasting Applications

### **Recommended Models by Growth Pattern**

| Growth Pattern | Best Forecasting Methods | Excel Functions |
|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Organic** | Moving averages, ARIMA | `AVERAGE()`, `FORECAST.LINEAR()` |
| **Exponential** | Exponential smoothing | `FORECAST.ETS()` |
| **Logarithmic** | Trend analysis with limits | `GROWTH()`, `LOGEST()` |
| **Linear** | Linear regression | `FORECAST.LINEAR()`, `TREND()` |
| **S-Curve** | Multi-phase modeling | Custom formulas |
| **Burst-and-Fade** | Decay models | `EXP()` functions |
| **Cyclic** | Seasonal decomposition | `FORECAST.ETS.SEASONALITY()` |

### **Analysis Techniques**

#### **1. Trend Analysis**
```excel
=FORECAST.LINEAR(future_date, known_views, known_dates)
```

#### **2. Moving Averages**
```excel
=AVERAGE(OFFSET(current_cell, -6, 0, 7, 1))  // 7-day moving average
```

#### **3. Exponential Smoothing**
```excel
=alpha * actual_value + (1-alpha) * previous_forecast
```

#### **4. Seasonal Adjustment**
```excel
=FORECAST.ETS(target_date, values, timeline, [seasonality], [data_completion])
```

## 📊 Advanced Analytics

### **Key Performance Indicators**
- **Growth Rate**: `(Current Views - Previous Views) / Previous Views * 100`
- **Engagement Rate**: `(Likes + Comments + Shares) / Views * 100`
- **Subscriber Conversion**: `New Subscribers / Views * 100`
- **Content Efficiency**: `Average Views / Videos Uploaded`

### **Seasonal Analysis**
